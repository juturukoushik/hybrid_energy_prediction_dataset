Project Title:-
**Hybrid Energy Prediction Project**

Description:-  
This project predicts how much energy can be generated from multiple renewable sources like solar and wind using AI and machine learning. The goal is to help manage and plan energy usage efficiently.

In this 30% phase, the dataset was collected from Kaggle, cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed. An initial prediction model has been built to estimate hybrid energy output.

Dataset:-  
The dataset (intermittent-renewables-production-france.csv) contains solar and wind energy production data with time, date, and related features. It helps train the model to understand energy generation patterns over time.

Implementation Progress:-  
-Collected dataset from Kaggle  
-Cleaned and preprocessed data  
-Engineered features like date, time, and energy source  
-Built and tested initial AI/ML prediction model
